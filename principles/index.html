            <p class="lead">
                These are the laws that govern MirrorDNA systems. They exist because AI without constraints is AI
                without trust.

                <p class="principle-def">
                    Every claim is classified as FACT, ESTIMATE, or UNKNOWN. No invention. No hallucination. No
                    confident wrongness.
                </p>
                <p class="principle-why">
                    <strong>Why it exists:</strong> LLMs generate plausible-sounding text regardless of truth. This is
                    the failure mode that erodes trust. Truth-State Law forces explicit uncertainty acknowledgment.
                </p>
                <p class="principle-how">
                    <strong>How it's implemented:</strong> SCD Protocol v3.1 requires truth-state annotation on all
                    outputs. Inference is wrapped — claims without classification are blocked. Verification against
                    vault is mandatory for FACT status.

                    Identity and state are cryptographically anchored. SHA256 checksums on identity files. Automatic
                    drift detection and alerting.
                </p>
                <p class="principle-why">
                    <strong>Why it exists:</strong> AI systems can gradually diverge from intended behavior — prompt
                    mutation, context contamination, subtle parameter drift. Zero Drift catches these before they
                    compound.
                </p>
                <p class="principle-how">
                    <strong>How it's implemented:</strong> Identity kernel files are checksummed at write. Every read
                    validates against stored checksum. Mismatch triggers hard block. Protected fields cannot be
                    overwritten by inference.

                <p class="principle-def">
                    The vault is the source of truth. Memory and inference defer to vault contents. Generated content
                    does not override stored content.
                </p>
                <p class="principle-why">
                    <strong>Why it exists:</strong> LLMs can generate convincing but incorrect information. When there's
                    a conflict between what the model "thinks" and what's stored, storage wins. Always.
                </p>
                <p class="principle-how">
                    <strong>How it's implemented:</strong> Vault reading happens before inference. Retrieved content is
                    injected as context with higher priority than model weights. Write operations require explicit human
                    approval or deterministic triggers.

                    Errors block, not allow. When something goes wrong, the system denies access rather than granting
                    it. Defense-first posture.
                </p>
                <p class="principle-why">
                    <strong>Why it exists:</strong> Most security failures come from "fail-open" defaults — if the auth
                    check errors, let them in anyway. Fail-closed means uncertainty = denial.
                </p>
                <p class="principle-how">
                    <strong>How it's implemented:</strong> AMGL Guard wraps all inference. Any exception → block.
                    Unknown request type → block. Validation failure → block. No silent passthrough.

                <p class="principle-why">
                    <strong>Why it exists:</strong> Dependency on external APIs means dependency on external policy.
                    OpenAI can change terms. Anthropic can deprecate endpoints. Your hardware, your rules.

                <p class="principle-how">
                    <strong>How it's implemented:</strong> Core inference runs on Ollama with local models. ChromaDB for
                    vector storage. Vault on local filesystem. Cloud APIs (Claude, Gemini) are used for capability
                    extension only, never core identity.

                <p class="principle-why">
                    <strong>Why it exists:</strong> Today's best model is tomorrow's legacy. Lock-in is technical debt.
                    Portability is freedom.

                <p class="principle-how">
                    <strong>How it's implemented:</strong> Identity kernel is JSON — readable by any model. SCD Protocol
                    is prompt-based, not API-specific. Handoffs work across Claude ↔ Gemini ↔ local models. No
