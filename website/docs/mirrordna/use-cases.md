## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Observability Stack

```
Agent → MirrorDNA SDK → ActiveMirrorOS → Glyphtrail
                              ↓
                        Analytics DB
```

### Pattern 2: Compliance Workflow

```
Agent → MirrorDNA → TrustByDesign → Compliance Dashboard
                          ↓
                    Audit Reports
```

### Pattern 3: CI/CD Integration

```
Agent Tests → MirrorDNA Traces → Quality Gates
                                        ↓
                                  Pass/Fail
```

## Getting Started

1. **Identify your use case**: Which scenario matches your needs?
2. **Start small**: Instrument one agent or workflow
3. **Measure impact**: Track metrics before and after
4. **Scale gradually**: Expand to more agents and use cases
